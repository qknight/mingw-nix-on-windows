how to use this:
 - move the git contents into ~/.nixpkgs/
 - nix-env -qa '*' 
 - nix-env -i winmingw

# based on mingw-get-inst-20110211.exe
http://lastlog.de/misc/MinGW-2011-02-11.tar.bz2
-> winmingw.nix

# qt library
http://lastlog.de/misc/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.7.1.zip
-> winqt.nix
NOTE: when doing: 'unzip qt-every*.zip' in cygwin, there is an issue with
      the path names. the problem is that:
      configure and configure.exe can not exist in the same direcotry!
  
      so unzip will prompt for a decission to either [r]ename or [o]verwrite
      configure.exe with configure

      another example of the same issue:
        just try: touch AB; touch AB.exe (works)
        just try: touch AB.exe; touch AB (fails)
      why is that?

# original goals: 
# - install qt in nix but using mingw instead of cygwin-native gcc.
#   one could use the nix package manager but also have native windows
#   applications
#
# it turned out that this can not be done
# - problems as PATH for programs
#   nix package manger uses symlinks, DLLs in nix on windows are also symlinked
#   to execute a program in windows, the PATH needs to be extended
#   PATH = %PATH%;c:\MinGW\bin so that programs like mingw32-make can
#   work correctly. but PATH on windows also includes DLL files, but windows does
#   NOT have RPATH features nor LD_LIBRARY_PATH (like unix). therefore using foo.dll 
#   several times is not possible. only one foo.dll MAY BE existent in the PATH
#   -> it would also not matter if all foo.dll files are the same, but
#      that does not happen most of the time ;-)
#   a possible solution would be: install side-by-side shared files,
#   see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms995843.aspx
#   title: Chapter 3: Component Sharing
#
# - problem path names and convenient functionality of cygwin
#   unzip qt-*.zip does not work in cygwin as configure and configure.exe
#   can not exist in the same directory (dependent on creation order)
